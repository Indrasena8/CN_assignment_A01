Program A 1: Validating IP Adresses
1. Group details:
	* Amogha Manjunatha K	1KS17CS006
	* Chandana B R 		1KS17CS018
	* Indrasena Kalyanam	1KS17CS030

2. Challenges/issues faced:
	We couldn't figure out how to split the ip address or compare an ip address to validate.
Solution: We recalled our 4th sem DAA Laboratory programs in which we used split() function to separate a dot(.) 

3. Execution:
	We enter the IP address through command line arguments on command prompt
	Example: HA01G03A 8.8.0.1
	OUTPUT: 8.8.0.1 is Valid

4. Description:
*Accepts an IP address
*Splits the IP address by .(dot) using split() function (Divides IP address into 4 divisions)
*Convert String to integer of each division
*Compares and outputs the results
